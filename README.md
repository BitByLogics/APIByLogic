# JustAPI

JustAPI is a set of APIs developed by me that I find useful.

## Noteworthy Features

- Smooth and functional Redis API
- Headache preventing Hikari API
- Single line Spigot menu creation

## Documentation / Examples

This is still very much in development so over time the GitHub will be populated with examples for various APIs
expect that to happen randomly without much of a schedule.
